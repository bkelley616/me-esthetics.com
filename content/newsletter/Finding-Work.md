In my newfound spare time, I will be interviewing with a few spas in my area. I have had a few interviews, but not many of them were promising. On August 4th, I will be interviewing at Lava Massage South in Broadview Heights. I have been a repeat client at Lava Massage South and have left pleased after every visit. The spa has a great calming energy and a wonderful staff that I hope to be joining as an esthetician soon. 
When I had my phone interview with Lava Massage south, I was pleased to hear that they are building a whole new spa with two floors. They will have a salt spa, a sauna, and each esthetician and massage therapist will receive their own room to work out of. They also plan to offer makeup applications as a service following the renovations.
