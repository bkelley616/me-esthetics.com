Today was my final day at the Brown Aveda institute! Since starting my program in January of 2021, I have fallen in love with the esthetics world. I have learned that my favorite parts of the program were customized facials and waxing. But, on my own I have also taken the time to learn brow tinting and lamination as well as lash lifting and tinting. I plan to further my education with a dermaplaning certification and a microblading certification. Next stop on the journey is interviewing with spas! I can't wait to see what the future has in store for my career.
